Focus is a force multiplier. 

I know this. I have heard so many stories about how important focus is. I have been struggling with it.

While working as a 9-5 employee, I worked on 1-2 projects at a time. My goal was to execute on those projects to the best of my capabilities. My managed evaluated my performance based on how well I did on these projects. Everything else was a distraction. These constraints helped me focus.

Once Neer was born, focus became even more important. I had limited time in my day for my side projects. I had to work on the project that had the highest ROI. I had to focus otherwise AMFJ wouldn't exist and survive.

And that worked. AMFJ grew and I was able to quit my job.

Becoming self-employed was fun. I no longer had to answer to anybody. I owned my time. 

And this is where my lack of focus started getting worse.

No longer bound by time constraints - I have been exploring many ideas at the same time. FOMO is real. Comparing myself to others. 

The end result? Not making meaningful progress on any of them. 

What I have realized is that constraints are good. Constraints, even self-imposed, are necessary.

In practice, I am thinking of splitting my time into exploratory and focus chunks. In the exploratory chunks - I let my curiosity take me wherever it wants. But, timeboxing is critical here. Otherwise, I can spend the whole day going down rabbit holes.

When its time to focus, I try my best to block out all distractions. My goal is to make meaningful progress in one area that I care about.
