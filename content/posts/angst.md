My wife mentioned yesterday that she doesn't want to quit her job yet. Why? Because then that would make 2 of us dealing with angst.

I wasn't expecting that. I had to look up the meaning of angst:

> A feeling of deep anxiety or dread. Feeling unfocused. Don't care about the state of the world.

Deep anxiety or dread? Nah, more like mild anxiety. But yeah, definitely dealing with bouts of feeling unfocused.

So, that got me thinking - why am I feeling this way? 

I no longer work for the man. I run my own business. I have control over my time. I should not be feeling this way.

If only the mind worked that way. For years, I dreamed of being able to quit my job and run my own business. I quit my job 6 months ago and my business is doing growing at a steady pace. Nothing exceptional but good enough.

But the goalposts keep moving. I want to strive for more. I want to start more business.  I want to build bigger businesses. 

While there is nothing inherently wrong with ambition, it is tricky to tie your self-worth to it. I don't have the answers yet for how to balance the two. 

I am trying to focus on enjoying the process and the journey. Trying not to worry too much about the outcomes. I can't control the outcomes anyway. I want to keep getting better and there is nothing wrong with wanting to do more things. But, I have to be careful, not to attach my self-worth to the outcomes.

I had no idea that my first business would be successful and give me the opportunity to quit my job. Most people don't get that opportunity. I am grateful for that and I want to maximize it my focusing on activities that make me happy.
