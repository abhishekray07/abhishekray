When I was younger, I used to set goals for myself. Most of these goals would be way in the future and most of the time I would not succeed in achieving this goals. A couple of years ago I read this [blog post] (https://blog.dilbert.com/2013/11/18/goals-vs-systems/) by Scott Adams where he talks about the different between Goals & Systems.

According to Adams, a goal is harder to maintain and most people end up losing willpower. I believe this happens because a goal is generally pretty abstract and it becomes harder and harder to motivate yourself if you don't receive regular feedback.

A system on the other hand, is very much like a habit. For e.g. if your goal is to write a book (abstract), a good system could be to write for 30 minutes every day. A system or habit is much more tractable and you get immediate feedback.  

I have personally started using systems a lot more in my life instead of just setting goals. For e.g.

- I try to read for 30 minutes every day which has helped me read more than 30 books last year.
- I try to be active every day (either going to the gym or for a run or a long walk)
