Uncertainty 

One thing I miss from my 9-5 past is certainty.

Do my job well and I will get rewarded for it.

Entrepreneurship provides no such guarantees. You can do everything right and things might not work out the way you want.

But, that is the beauty of life. Certainty is boring in most cases. Whats the point of going through life where you know what the outcome will be?
